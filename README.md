# StrayKidsDiscordBot

Laravel Web App for image uploading and Discord bot for image posting.

Totally unfinished project that is an attempt to be a bulk image uploader for a Discord bot to post to a Discord channel. Was targeted to be for StrayKids pictures but really it never got there. I didn't get far enough to give it any branding. Honestly I just barely got to finishing the image uploader.

I don't really care to finish it due to personal reasons. But could be a good thing to fork and finish.

TODO:
 - Tie the Discord bot to the same data store as the image uploader (database and file storage)
 - Make it look better
 - Profit?
